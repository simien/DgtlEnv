## 🏷️ Naming Conventions

### Files and Directories

- **Directories:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `system-metrics`, `pdf-converter`)
- **Scripts:** Use kebab-case with descriptive names (e.g., `swap-ssd-health.sh`, `pdf-to-markdown-converter.sh`)
- **Documentation:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `optimization-summary.md`, `pdf-conversion-and-metrics-system.md`)
- **Templates:** Use descriptive names with type suffix (e.g., `cursor-settings-performance.json`)

### Script Naming

- **Monitoring scripts:** `*-health.sh`, `*-monitor.sh`
- **Cleanup scripts:** `*-cleanup.sh`
- **Optimization scripts:** `*-optimize.sh`
- **Conversion scripts:** `*-converter.sh`
- **Backup scripts:** `*-backup.sh`

### Variables and Functions

- **Shell variables:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `SYSTEM_STATUS`, `PDF_COUNT`)
- **Shell functions:** snake_case (e.g., `check_system_health()`, `convert_pdf_to_markdown()`)
- **Configuration keys:** kebab-case (e.g., `system-status`, `pdf-count`)

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation only changes
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(monitoring): add swap usage monitoring to health check
fix(converter): resolve PDF conversion error for large files
docs(readme): update system requirements and setup instructions
perf(dashboard): optimize metrics collection for better performance
refactor(cleanup): restructure Docker cleanup script for better maintainability
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

1. **Use imperative mood:** "add" not "added" or "adds"
2. **Don't capitalize the first letter**
3. **No dot (.) at the end**
4. **Keep it under 50 characters for the subject line**
5. **Use the body to explain what and why vs. how**

## 🔒 Privacy & Sanitization

This project maintains a strict separation between public code and personal configuration.

### The `.personal` Directory
- All personal files, private keys, and specific identifiers are stored in `.personal/`
- This directory is git-ignored by default
- Do not commit files from `.personal/` to the public repository

### Automatic Sanitization
- The `scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh` script runs automatically before release
- It scans for PII (emails, names, serial numbers)
- It verifies that no private files are accidentally included in the public directory
- Always run `./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --dry-run` before submitting a PR

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **System Health Check:**
   ```bash
   ./ops/monitoring/swap-ssd-health.sh
   ```

2. **Performance Testing:**
   ```bash
   ./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh baseline
   # Run your changes
   ./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh current
   ./metrics/system-metrics-tracker.sh compare
   ```

3. **PDF Conversion Testing:**
   ```bash
   ./ops/backup/simple-pdf-converter.sh convert docs/test.pdf
   ```

4. **Pre-Release Security Testing:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --dry-run
   ./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --fix
   ./scripts/pre-release-sanitizer.sh --dry-run
   ```

### Automated Testing

- All scripts should include error handling
- Scripts should validate inputs and provide meaningful error messages
- Performance-critical scripts should include timing measurements

### Test Coverage

- **Shell scripts:** Test with different input scenarios
- **Documentation:** Verify all links and code examples work
- **Performance:** Ensure no regression in system performance
- **Security:** Run pre-release sanitizer before commits
- **Personal Information:** Verify no personal data in releases

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### README Files

Every directory should have a `README.md` file that includes:

1. **Purpose:** What this directory contains and why
2. **Usage:** How to use the scripts/tools in this directory
3. **Examples:** Practical examples of common use cases
4. **Dependencies:** Any external dependencies or requirements
5. **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions

### Code Documentation

- **Shell scripts:** Include header comments with purpose, usage, and examples
- **Functions:** Document parameters, return values, and side effects
- **Complex logic:** Add inline comments explaining the reasoning

### Example Script Header

```

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Script Performance

- **Minimize external calls:** Batch operations where possible
- **Use efficient data structures:** Prefer arrays over repeated string operations
- **Implement caching:** Cache expensive operations when appropriate
- **Profile scripts:** Use `time` command to measure performance

### System Impact

- **Monitor resource usage:** Ensure scripts don't consume excessive CPU/memory
- **Implement timeouts:** Prevent scripts from running indefinitely
- **Use appropriate scheduling:** Run heavy operations during low-usage periods

### Optimization Guidelines

1. **Measure first:** Profile existing code before optimizing
2. **Optimize bottlenecks:** Focus on the slowest parts
3. **Test thoroughly:** Ensure optimizations don't introduce bugs
4. **Document changes:** Explain why optimizations were made

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Script Security

- **Validate inputs:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Use absolute paths:** Avoid relying on PATH for security-critical operations
- **Implement proper permissions:** Use appropriate file permissions
- **Avoid command injection:** Use parameterized commands

### Data Handling

- **Sensitive data:** Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- **Logging:** Avoid logging sensitive information
- **File permissions:** Use appropriate file permissions for sensitive files

### Pre-Release Security

- **Run sanitizer:** Always run pre-release sanitizer before commits
- **Personal information:** Ensure no personal data in public releases
- **Security scanning:** Use automated security checks
- **Documentation review:** Verify all documentation is sanitized

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Communication Channels

- **Issues:** Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions:** Use GitHub Discussions for questions and general discussion
- **Security:** Use GitHub Security Advisories for security issues

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Check existing documentation:** Review README files and documentation
2. **Search existing issues:** Look for similar problems or requests
3. **Reproduce the issue:** Ensure you can consistently reproduce the problem
4. **Provide context:** Include system information, error messages, and steps to reproduce
